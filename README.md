# Xeegify


Xeegify is a repository for boilerplate stubs for popular frameworks and programming languages.

The aim of xeegify is to serve as an easy go to source for stub definitions for the programming languages and frameworks of their choice. Here, it is similar to the concept of shared, reusable components. In our case however, where we develop stub files that can be used by other developers instead of creating their own stub files (which is also similar to what TypeStrong is doing for npm packages).
